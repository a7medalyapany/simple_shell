## Background Context

Hey there, let's get you up "This is a Simple UNIX Command Interpreter" project.

### Project Overview

Buckle up, because we're about to dive into building a basic UNIX command interpreter. This means creating our very own program that lets us input and execute commands, just like we do in a regular terminal.

### Ready to Dive In?

This project is a goldmine of learning opportunities. Here's what's in store for you:

- **Getting the Repo**: First things first, you gotta clone the repo to your local machine. Open up your terminal and run this command:
- ```
  git clone https://github.com/a7medalyapany/simple_shell.git
- **Running the Program**:  Once you've got everything ready, run the program like this:
- ```
  ./hsh
- **Adding Extra Code**:  If you've made changes to the code, you gotta build the project again. Use this command:
- ```
  gcc -o hsh *.c

### Navigating the Interpreter

Once the code is ready, you'll have your very own interpreter at your fingertips. Enter commands just like you do in your regular terminal, and watch the magic unfold as they get executed.
