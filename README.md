## Background Context

Hey there, let's get you up to speed on the "Background Context: Write a Simple UNIX Command Interpreter" project.

### Project Overview

Buckle up, because we're about to take on the challenge of building a basic UNIX command interpreter. This means creating our very own program that lets us input and execute commands, just like we do in a regular terminal. Exciting, right?

### Learning Goals

This project is a goldmine of learning opportunities. Here's what's in store for you:

- **Mastering C**: Strengthen your C programming skills.
- **Decoding the Shell**: Grasp the fundamentals of how a UNIX shell operates.
- **Problem Solving**: Tackle various commands and scenarios head-on.
- **Teamwork**: This is a group effort, so teamwork is non-negotiable.
- **Learning How to Learn**: Embrace the process and level up your skills.

### Navigating the Interpreter

Once the code is ready, you'll have your very own interpreter at your fingertips. Enter commands just like you do in your regular terminal, and watch the magic unfold as they get executed.

### Project Guidelines

There are a few ground rules to keep things on track:

- **Original Work**: No shortcuts hereâ€”create your own code.
- **Understanding Is Key**: It's not about copying, it's about understanding.
- **Learning, Not Copying**: Skip the step-by-step guides and solutions.
- **All-Inclusive Collaboration**: Group effort means shared responsibility.
- **No Sneaky Cheating**: Using AI tools for the whole solution? Not allowed.

### Ready to Dive In?

Get ready to unleash your inner coding ninja! While this project might seem like a tough nut, you've got all the tools you need to crack it wide open. Forget about Google for nowâ€”focus on understanding and tackling challenges. Remember, it's not about memorizing the solution; it's about the journey to get there.
